# Outline

We have two possible ways to get the distances between the $y_i$ points. In the first way, we translate the $x_i$ points with noise: $a_i$, and then calculate the distances between the $x_i$, denoted $D_{ij}$ and then the distances between the $y_i$, denoted $G_{ij}$. In the second method, we use the mixed effects model:

$$
\E[G_{ij}] = \beta D_{ij} + Z\boldsymbol{a}, 
$$

that is based on the Taylor expansion.
